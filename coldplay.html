        <h3>Music of the Spheres World Tour, Amsterdam Johan Cruiff Arena 2023 wristband project.</h3>
        <p>For this concert there was a fanproject during the whole concert where fans were giving a wrist band which had a light reacting to all songs so they made little shapes and stars. Every show has these light bands which i find super cute and creative.</p>
