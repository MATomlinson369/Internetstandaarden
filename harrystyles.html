        <h3>Fine Line, Amsterdam Johan Cruiff Arena 2023</h3>
        <p>My rating of the love on tour concert is a solid 7/10. The concert itself was great, Harry himself was very energetic with the crowd and his singing was great. However the sound quality in the arena was super bad, i stood right underneath a speaker my 2nd day and the sound quality was not great. But the vibes of the concert itself was an amazing expierence! </p>

        <h3>Fine Line, Amsterdam Johan Cruiff Arena 2023.</h3>
        <p>For this concert there was a fanproject during the song 'Fine Line where fans put colour paper over their flashlights during the show to make a blue and pink light. Every show has this fanproject which i find super cute.</p>
