    <p class="concertdate">Fine Line, Amsterdam Johan Cruiff Arena 2023.</p>
    <p class="videotext">My rating of the Amsterdam LOT concert is a solid 7/10. The concert itself was amazing, Harrt himself was very energetic with the crowd and his singing was amazing. However the first day that i went i had seating tickets which was a bummer in my opinion the people around me were not singing half as much as the people did when i stood in the pit, But the vibes of the concert itself was an amazing expierence! </p>

    <p class="projecttxt">For this concert there was a fanproject during the song 'Fine Line where fans put colour paper over their flashlights during the show to make a blue and pink light. Every show has this fanproject which i find super cute.</p>
