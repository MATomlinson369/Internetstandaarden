    <p class="concertdate">Faith In The Future World Tour, Amsterdam Ziggo Dome 2023.</p>
    <p class="videotext">My rating of the Amsterdam FITF concert is a solid 8/10. The concert itself was amazing, Louis himself was very energetic with the crowd and his singing was amazing. However to be at least a bit close to the stage i had to wait 12 hours in line to be number 426 because a lot of people camped for the concert which was a bit of a bummer. But the vibes of the concert itself was an amazing expierence! </p>

    <p class="fanprojecttxt">Faith In The Future World Tour, Amsterdam Ziggo Dome 2023. Fan project.</p>
    <p class="projecttxt">For this concert there was a fanproject during the song 'Angels Fly' where fans were handing out paper stars to put over their flashlights during the show to make a yellow light. Every show has a different fanproject which i find super cute.</p>
